# Enabling GCP and AI APIs

## Setting Up Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

To enable GCP services for your technical analysis system, start by visiting the Google Cloud Console at console.cloud.google.com and sign in with your Google account. If this is your first time using GCP, you'll need to accept the terms of service and set up billing (new users get $300 in free credits valid for 90 days). Create a new project by clicking the project dropdown at the top of the page, selecting "New Project," and giving it a meaningful name like "technical-analysis-prod." Once your project is created and selected, navigate to the "APIs & Services" section from the left sidebar menu, then click "Enable APIs and Services" at the top. Search for and enable the following APIs one by one: Cloud Run API, Cloud Functions API, Cloud Firestore API, Cloud Storage API, Pub/Sub API, Cloud Scheduler API, Cloud Build API, and Cloud Logging API. Each API takes just a few seconds to enable. After enabling all APIs, you'll need to set up authentication by going to "APIs & Services > Credentials," clicking "Create Credentials," and selecting "Service Account." Create a service account with an appropriate name (like "technical-analysis-service"), grant it the roles "Editor" or more specific roles like "Cloud Run Admin," "Cloud Functions Developer," and "Firestore User," then create and download a JSON key file which you'll use for authentication in your code. This service account key should be kept secure and never committed to version control.

## Setting Up Google's Gemini AI API

To enable Gemini AI for intelligent signal ranking, visit Google AI Studio at aistudio.google.com and sign in with your Google account. Click "Get API Key" in the top right corner, which will redirect you to Google Cloud Console if you're not already there. If you haven't created a GCP project yet, follow the steps above first, as the Gemini API is accessed through Google Cloud's infrastructure. Once in the API console, you may see a prompt to enable the Generative Language API (this is the API that powers Gemini) - click "Enable" and wait a few moments for activation. After the API is enabled, click "Create Credentials" and select "API Key" from the dropdown menu. Google will generate an API key that looks like a long string of random characters (e.g., "AIzaSyB..."). Copy this key immediately and store it securely - you'll use it as your GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable in the notebook. For production use, consider restricting the API key by clicking the three-dot menu next to it, selecting "Edit API key," and adding application restrictions (like restricting to specific IP addresses) and API restrictions (limiting it to only the Generative Language API). Be aware that Gemini API has rate limits on the free tier (typically 60 requests per minute and 1,500 requests per day for the free tier, though this may vary by region), so if you're analyzing many stocks, you may hit these limits. You can monitor your usage and quota in the Google Cloud Console under "APIs & Services > Dashboard" where you'll see request counts and can set up billing alerts if you approach paid tier usage.
